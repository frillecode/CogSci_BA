### Overview of repository
The scripts above features the code used to produce the simulation. To run the simulation use **main.R**. 

The **Results** folder features dataframes with results from our simulation together with scripts for analysing and vizualizing these. 

**my_edgelist.csv** is the edgelist determining how posteriors are passed in the citation-based chain of tranmission in the simulation. The **citation network** folder contains the code and data used to create the current edgelist. Within **main.R** it is possible to change which edgelist you want to be used in the simulation.
